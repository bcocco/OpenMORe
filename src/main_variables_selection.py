@Brief: 
    Variable selection via Principal Component Analysis and Procustes Analysis.

@Details: 
    In many applications, rather than reducing the dimensionality considering a
    new set of coordinates which are linear combination of the original ones, the main
    interest is to achieve a dimensionality reduction selecting a subset of m variables
    from the original set of p variables. One of the possible ways to accomplish this
    task is to couple the PCA dimensionality reduction with a Procustes Analysis.
    The iterative Local Principal Component Analysis clustering algorithm is based on the following steps:
    0. Preprocessing: The training matrix X is centered and scaled, after being loaded. Four scaling are available,
    AUTO, VAST, PARETO, RANGE - Two centering are available, MEAN and MIN;
    1. The dimensionality of m is initially set equal to p.
    2. Each variable is deleted from the matrix X, obtaining p ~X matrices. The
    corresponding scores matrices are computed by means of PCA. For each
    of them, a Procustes Analysis is performed with respect to the scores of the original matrix X, 
    and the corresponding M2 coeffcient is computed.
    3. The variable which, once excluded, leads to the smallest M2 coefficient is deleted from the matrix.
    4. Steps 2 and 3 are repeated until m variables are left.
