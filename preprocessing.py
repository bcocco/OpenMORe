@Brief: 
    Centering and scaling functions for multivariate data.

@Details: 
    In multivariate data-sets the variables are characterized by different units and ranges,
    thus preprocessing in the form of centering and scaling is a mandatory operation.
    Centering consists of subtracting the mean/min value of each variable to all data-set
    observations. Scaling is achieved by dividing each variable by a given scaling factor. Therefore, the
    i-th observation of the j-th variable, x_{i,j} can be
    centered and scaled by means of:

    \tilde{x_{i,j}} = (x_{i,j} - mu_{j}) / (sig_{j}),

    where mu_{j} and sig_{j} are the centering and scaling factor for the considered j-th variable, respectively.

    AUTO: the standard deviation of each variable is used as a scaling factor.
    PARETO: the squared root of the standard deviation is used as a scaling f.
    RANGE: the difference between the minimum and the maximum value is adopted as a scaling f.
    VAST: the ratio between the variance and the mean of each variable is used as a scaling f.
